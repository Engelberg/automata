# automata
Code for the first half of the Clojure Conj 2015 talk I did with Alex Engelberg.

The talk can be found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEhULv4ruL4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEhULv4ruL4)

The idea behind the talk is that there are many interesting problems that can be analyzed and solved by looking at them through the lens of Finite State Machines.  The first half of the talk deals primarily with an interesting programming puzzle known as the maximal non-segment sum problem.

The code here is written in a fairly literate style, with lots of explanation in the comments that goes more in-depth than the video, so I encourage you to check out the code.

The code for the second half of the talk, which focuses primarily on loco's support for regular expression constraints, can be found at [Alex's github repo](https://github.com/aengelberg/automata).
